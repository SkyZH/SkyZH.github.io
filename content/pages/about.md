I’m a junior undergraduate student studying Computer Science at
[Shanghai Jiao Tong University](http://en.sjtu.edu.cn/) (SJTU).
I’m expected to graduate in 2022.

My real name is Chi Zhang. As the name is too common in Chinese culture, I’m generally
referred to as **Alex Chi**.

In my second year at SJTU, I applied for a research internship.
It turned out that the whole experience was a disaster for me. For half a year
I had nothing to do, except attending weekly lab meetups. I had no idea of what
the team was doing, and what I could do. I suffered a lot, questioning myself,
"Am I qualified for this position?" The next semester I quit that team.
Only then did I find myself more of **an engineer** than a researcher.

My past experience focuses on building system software with the Rust programming
language, especially storage systems. I built [AgateDB](https://github.com/tikv/agatedb) during my
internship in PingCAP. Also, I love becoming part of the open-source
community. Currently, I'm a contributor of [the TiKV project](https://tikv.org)
and a maintainer at [SJTUG mirror](https://mirrors.sjtug.sjtu.edu.cn).
In a nutshell, **I build things that interest me, excite me, and impact people**.

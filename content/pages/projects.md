## Early Days

The fun of programming was rooted in my heart from an early age. When I was ten years old, I began my journey in Computer Programming. At that time, I learned the basics of BASIC and the C programming language in Children's Palace of CWI. With this knowledge in mind, our mentors taught us how to make classic games in ASCII-character-based consoles, such as the Tetris game. Later I did some Ruby programming in RPG Maker, experimented with Visual Basic to build even more exciting GUI games, and learned the basics of game engines and graphics pipelines. Those first tastes of what computer programming could bring us motivated my curiosity and interest.

Another track in parallel is competitive programming. The highlighting moment came when I was in 9th grade, and I got first prize in NOIP among high school students. I quickly lost interest in memorizing and understanding those tricky algorithms, and that's the turning point.

Months later, I shifted my focus to build real-world applications, which opened up a whole new world for me. By composing and reusing components built by developers worldwide, I could easily make my ideas come alive. These attempts include [CloudOJ](https://github.com/skyzh/CloudOJ) and [BlueSense](https://github.com/skyzh/BlueSense). Another thing worth mention is the [ddcm-protocol](https://github.com/skyzh/ddcm-protocol), a P2P distributed computing framework based on Kademlia.

Building things with computer programming is fun, and it is even more exciting if what I've built could be used by others. These early experiences built a solid foundation for me and ultimately led me onto the track of studying Computer Science.
